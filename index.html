      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        MiniApp is a new format of mobile application, a hybrid solution which relies on Web technologies (especially CSS and Javascript) but also integrates with Native capabilities. Currently, MiniApps have mature deployments in cellphone and PC.
      </p>
      <p>
        IoT device is becoming another carrier running MiniApps. MiniApp for IoT intends to enable interoperability across multiple IoT device platforms and IoT operating systems. Rather than having to deal with the difference across the multiple IoT device platforms and IoT operating systems, by introducing MiniApps for IoT, developers only need to focus on the application development on IoT device.
      </p>
      <p>
        MiniApp for IoT shares similar <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/#separate-the-view-layer-from-the-logic-layer">architecture</a> of MiniApp running on the cellphone and PC. But since IoT device has different hardware capabilities, MiniApp for IoT has its unique features.
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of this specification is to provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a set of use cases of MiniApp for IoT</li>
        <li>a definition of MiniApp for IoT Architecture</li>
        <li>a definition of MiniApp Packaging for IoT</li>
        <li>a definition of MiniApp Lifecycle for IoT</li>
        <li>an overview of MiniApp APIs for IoT</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        This section presents the use cases targeted by MiniApp for IoT and which are used to derive the MiniApp Packaging for IoT, MiniApp Lifecycle for IoT, and MiniApp APIs for IoT.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following sections are not exhaustive. Rather they serve as illustrations, where MiniApp for IoT can provide additional benefit or enable new scenarios.

          <h2>Switch panel</h2>
          <p>
            The HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning) applications and lighting applications are usually deployed in homes and buildings, to manage the indoor environment. A switch panel is used to control the HVAC application and lighting application.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="#figure-miniapp-iot-use-case-switch-panel-screen-and-button">Figure 1</a> shows an example of HVAC application switch panel which has a screen and several physical buttons. In this case, by introducing MiniApp for IoT, the switch panel’s screen UI can be designed and developed using Web technologies, to display the HVAC information. For example, the target temperature value inputted by the physical and the measured real-time temperature value can be displayed.
          </p>

            <a href="#figure-miniapp-iot-use-case-switch-panel-touch-screen">Figure 2</a> shows an example of HAVC and lighting application switch panel which has a touch screen. In this case, by introducing MiniApp for IoT, the switch panel’s touch screen UI can be designed and developed using Web technologies, to both display information and control the indoor HAVC and lighting application. For example, information like measured real-time temperature value, current date and time, etc., can be displayed in one MiniApp page. Besides, by clicking the virtual button on the touch screen, it can navigate to another MiniApp page to configure and control the HAV and lighting application, like setting the target temperature, turn on or off the lights, etc.

          <h2>Gateway</h2>
          <p>
            In smart home scenarios, gateways are connected to local IoT devices such as sensors, cameras and home appliances through corresponding local communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Mesh, Zigbee, etc. At the same time, gateways can be connected to the cloud through the Internet. Usually, the gateways do not have a screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, by introducing MiniApp for IoT to gateway, the local device connection functionality (such as to establish connection between gateway and IoT device using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Mesh or Zigbee) and cloud connection functionality (such as to establish connection between gateway and cloud using MQTT or HTTP) can be designed and developed using Web technologies.

      <h2>MiniApp for IoT Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        To address the use cases in Section 2, this section provides the MiniApp for IoT Architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#figure-miniapp-iot-architecture">Figure 7</a> shows the MiniApp for IoT Architecture.
      </p>

      </figure>
      
      <p>
        Unlike MiniApps running on cellphone, which either run on top of a certain mobile App or run on top of mobile OS, MiniApp for IoT is running on top of IoT OS (operating system).
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar as MiniApps running on cellphone, in MiniApp for IoT, the View layer is usually separated from the Logic layer. The View layer is responsible for rendering MiniApp pages, including Web rendering and Native rendering. The Logic layer is responsible for MiniApp’s event processing, API calling and lifecycle management.
      </p>
      <p>
        MiniApp for IoT also have the Packaging and Lifecycle, which will be described in Section 4 and Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key features of MiniApp for IoT is that it deals with many IoT device native functionalities, including but not limited to IoT communication protocols (like MQTT, Bluetooth Mesh) management, I/O for peripheral (like, UART, GPIO, I2C, SPI), and hardware functionalities (like ADC, DAC, hardware timer). The details will be described in Section 6.

      <section>
        <h2>MiniApp Packaging for IoT device with a screen</h2>
        <p>
            The use cases in Section 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 show the MiniApp for IoT device with a screen, which is similar to the MiniApp running on cellphone or PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-packaging/">MiniApp Packaging</a> can be applied for MiniApp packaging for IoT device with a screen.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>MiniApp Packaging for IoT device without a screen</h2>
        <p>
            The use case in Section 2.2 shows the MiniApp for IoT device without a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, a simplified MiniApp Packaging’s directory and file system is defined to be applied for IoT device without a screen. Specifically, the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-packaging/#sec-miniapp-resources-css">CSS Resources</a> are not required.

      <h2>MiniApp Lifecycle for IoT</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-lifecycle/">MiniApp Lifecycle</a> needs to be extended for MiniApp lifecycle for IoT.
      </p>
      <p>
        MiniApp for cellphone either runs in foreground or background. When running in foreground, the MiniApp is shown to users. When user chooses to close the MiniApp by clicking the close button on MiniApp, or go to the mobile phone’s home screen, the MiniApp switches to run in background, which means the MiniApp is suspended in the background.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, in the case of MiniApp for IoT, when user chooses to close the MiniApp by clicking the close button on MiniApp, or go to the home screen, some MiniApps will still provide services to users and will not be suspended, like music playing. Therefore, a new lifecycle event and states need to be defined.
       </p>
       <section>
        <h2>MiniApp Global Application Lifecycle for IoT</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp-lifecycle/#miniapp-global-application-lifecycle-events">MiniApp Global Application Lifecycle Events</a> is extended to include one new global application lifecycle event for MiniApp for IoT:
